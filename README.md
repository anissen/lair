# _Intruder alert!_

_Behavior Trees Powered Evil Genius Secret Underground Lair Defender_


## About

This is a (work in progress) application of [behave](https://github.com/anissen/behave) (a behavior tree game AI library).


## The idea

You are an evil genius. Well not exactly a genius per say. You are somewhat evil, however, or at least you're trying to be.

There are agencies and people who try to foil your evil plans. They send spies and agents to infiltrate and destroy your not-so-secret underground lair.

You are not very good at handling the financial aspects of being an evil g... guy. So you're broke. In fact you only have a few rudimentary security robots to protect your lair while your build up your evil empire. 

Even worse the robots were bought cheap so they lack some features of normal modern security robots. Automated defence systems was unfortunetly just out of your price range. However you _could_ afford the semi-automatic, self-programmable, defence systems.

Your task is now to program your robots to protect your lair from the intruders!
